Worldview is a person’s views of the world, of himself and his place in the world, allowing him to navigate in reality.
In the structure of the worldview can distinguish the following levels:
- attitude - the level of primary experience of reality, which includes the emotions of feelings of experience.
- Understanding of the world - a rational level of worldview, involving the comprehension and explanation of reality. It includes knowledge, beliefs and values.
 Components in the structure of the worldview are divided into
- pragmatic - associated with the satisfaction of necessary needs and with rational activity.
- not pragmatic - associated with the moral, religious, ethnic interests of the person.
The main historical types of worldview:
1. Mythological.

For the mythological worldview characteristic:

- Personification - to consider natural phenomena by analogy with man
- Desires to explain events in the form of a descriptive story or tale
- Syncretism is not a division of the unity of the inner and outer world, mind and feelings.
- Genetism - an explanation of the essence through the origin.
- Communication with the ritual - the myth is transmitted through the collective symbolic reproduction of the first events.
- Connection with magic, expressed by the action of sorcerers and shamans.

2. Religious.

The religious form of the worldview consists in building a picture of the world based on the belief in the existence of supernatural power, which somehow explains everything that happens in the world. Formed because of the development of human thinking.

For a religious worldview characteristic:
- reliance on faith in the sacred
- ambivalence (duality) of reality, based on a person’s conception of the sacred and worldly
- connection with the ritual - honoring the object of faith, worshiping it through rituals and rituals.

All beliefs can be divided into polytheistic (Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt) and monotheistic (religion recognizes only one single God).

3. Philosophical.

The specificity of the philosophical worldview is that it integrates the most significant research results of other sciences (as well as arts, religions, everyday life, etc.) and, synthesizing them, creates the most common and holistic view of a particular object or subject. .

For a philosophical worldview characteristic:

- rational character: the philosophical worldview is based on thinking and intellectual activity.
- critical: nothing is taken for granted.
- reflectivity: self-reflection, focus on self-knowledge
- orderliness of ideas: philosophical ideas may not be directly related to practice.

4. Scientific.

The scientific form of the worldview is fundamentally different in that it builds a model of reality as close as possible to the truth, even if absolute truth is unattainable. Unlike other areas of human knowledge, science differs primarily in its purpose, which is to focus on the attainment of true knowledge, in an effort to achieve truth in a certain sphere of life.

Philosophy is a rational-critical type of worldview.

Philosophy is interested in those concepts that are related to problems of worldview.

The basis of the section of philosophical outlook:

- Ontology (teaching about being)
- Axiology (about values)
- Gnoseology (cognition)
