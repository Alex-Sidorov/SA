Team Formation
The assumption here is that you will eventually find yourself working for an established
game development organization. In this world, a game development effort begins with
several things that do not involve programming. Among these are contracts, a game
design document, and a corporate production plan. Rights must be secured, funding must
be approved, and a corporate production schedule must be created. After all this activity
has been completed, a project manager or team lead is chosen for the programming effort.
The project manger’s first job, usually, is to assess how much effort development of the
software that supports the game will require and how many people will be needed to complete
the project on time.
Although no formula covers all situations, if you find yourself in the project management
position, you will probably conclude that you require a team who is capable of performing
a few basic types of activity:
Plan and manage the development effort.
Know the answers to difficult technical questions.
Answer questions about how the game has been designed and what goals its functionality
should support.
Perform secondary or specialized programming tasks that require a high investment
of time.
Create documentation for the project.
Perform or coordinate work that involves game assets, such as sound and graphics.
Work on tools that can support various development activities.
