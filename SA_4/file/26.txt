Question 13. The philosophy of nature. The idea of ​​co-evolution of society and nature. The role of synergy in the comprehension of being.
Nature is a form of being. The concept of nature is multivalued. Being one of the most important universals of culture, it reflects the evolution of human ideas about nature, as well as the development of natural science and philosophical knowledge about it. Currently, the concept of "nature" is used in three basic meanings:
• all existing (being, being);
• human habitat;
• the essence of things.
The philosophy of nature develops a synthetic concept of the interaction between man and nature, the basic principles of which are the following: the prosperity of any form of life on Earth is valuable in itself, and the value of life does not depend on the benefits to man; people do not have the right to reduce natural diversity, except in cases of satisfaction of natural needs; modern intrusion of man into the natural world worsens the state of both of them;

Nature - the totality of the natural conditions of human existence and human society. Wildlife - the basis, without a cat. there would be neither a human being descended from animal ancestors, nor a society, a cat. replaced the primitive herd of these ancestors. In the world - the process of metabolism m / y man, society and nature. Society is a continuation of nature.
The contradictory nature of relations in the society-nature system is already seen in the fact that, on the one hand, as society develops, it increasingly masters the forces of nature and its wealth. All this is realized in the development of productive forces. On the other hand, the more a person subordinates nature to himself, the more he depends on it. From this increasing dependence on the horizon, thoughts about future environmental problems are visible.
