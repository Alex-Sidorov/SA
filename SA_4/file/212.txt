Question 5. German classical philosophy: Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach.
The German philosophy of the second half of the 18th - first half of the 19th centuries, which entered the history of world philosophy under the name of classical, begins with Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804). His philosophical work is traditionally divided into two sub-types: subcritical and critical.
Philosophical views. Subcritical period. Dealing with the problems of natural science, Kant made a number of serious discoveries. The most important achievements in this field were the following:
 • developed a nebular theory of the origin of the solar system, according to which the sun and the planets were formed under the influence of gravity from a huge gaseous cloud of dust; Re-formulated by Laplace in The World System Statement (1796), this theory was widely recognized in the 19th century. under the name "Kant-Laplace hypothesis";
• proved that as a result of the tides and ebbs the daily rotation of the Earth slows down.
The critical period is the doctrine of "pure reason." Kant formulated the main ideas of his teaching in the Critique of Pure Reason. The focus of his attention is on the problems of gnoseology, and his doctrine of knowledge, i.e. he called the “pure” or “theoretical” mind transcendental1 logic. In ontological issues, Kant is a deist by conviction, and therefore an objective idealist: for him, undoubtedly, the existence of God is the Creator of the world. But the problem of the existence of God is a matter of practical, not theoretical reason. Being within the framework of a pure mind, we can be sure of the existence of objects of only two types: the external world and the human consciousness. At the same time, the existence of our consciousness is obvious to us (remember the Cartesian "I think, therefore I exist"), and we know about the existence of objects of the external world through the data of our senses, which fix something that comes into consciousness from outside. Thus, within the framework of pure reason, Kant acts as a dualist, and since human consciousness is the initial reality and the main object of consideration, Kant can be called a subjective idealist. Since all that we know about the objects of the external world is their images, reflections, phenomena in our consciousness, the theoretical mind should distinguish these objects from their manifestations in our consciousness. Therefore, Kant introduces the following concepts.
