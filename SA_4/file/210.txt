Question 30. Philosophy and art. The specifics of the aesthetic attitude of man to the world.

Philosophy is one of those spheres of culture where the criteria of science are not fully effective. Thus, Berdyaev had reason to bring philosophy closer together with art rather than with science. In addition, as it is known, outstanding art works always carry deep philosophical and moral ideas, and many of their creators (I. Goethe, FM Dostoevsky, LN Tolstoy) are known as original thinkers. And a lot of philosophers (Plato, Voltaire, D. Diderot, F. Nietzsche, A. Camus) clothed their ideas in a highly artistic form.

Art is one of the most important elements of a culture in which artistic and aesthetic values ??are accumulated. Unlike other spheres of activity (occupation, profession, position, etc.) it is generally significant, without it it is impossible to imagine the life of people. But, despite the antiquity of art, its irreplaceable role in human life, the long history of aesthetics, the problem of the essence and specifics of art still remains largely unsolved.

Art and philosophy are similar in the presence of creativity in them, but art is focused on emotions, concrete images, fantasy, and philosophy is a rational use of categories, in which reality is sought after visibility.

Art is a kind of spiritual mastering of reality by a social person, with the goal of forming and developing his ability to creatively transform the world around him and himself according to the laws of beauty.
