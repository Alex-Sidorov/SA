Data compression is a form of data encryption, which is the act of taking a piece of
data and making it unreadable to people who don’t know how to decode it.
Data encryption is a vast subject, and it is of some importance here. If you were to
compress a text file using Huffman compression and then look at the resulting
data, would you be able to tell that it was text at one time? Probably not.
One of the most frequent questions I hear from programmers is, “How do I make
my graphics and sound so that no one can read it or modify it?” You would normally
use a form of data encryption, but you could also use compression. The average
person will not know how to decode your Huffman-encoded graphics. This is
one easy way to prevent people from ripping your graphics and sound from your
game and using them all over the place.

Compression
This chapter only gives you a very brief glimpse into the world of compression.
There are tons of methods out there to compress data.
One of the most exciting areas of compression is called fractal compression. A fractal
is a geometrical object that exhibits repeating and recurring features. For example,
if you look at a mountain and then zoom in to a small piece of it, it will look like a
smaller mountain. You can zoom in many times, and still see repeating patterns.
This type of thing happens all over the place in nature, such as coastlines, forests,
flowers, and so on. This type of compression tries to find repeating areas of graphics
or data and stores information on that.
Other forms of compression also exist. Another famous method is called wavelet
compression, which is used a great deal in signal processing because it is a good
method of compressing waveform data. I haven’t done much research in the field,
so I can’t say more about it.
Just be aware that the field of data compression is absolutely huge.
