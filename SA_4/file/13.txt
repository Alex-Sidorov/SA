Science and Engineering
Before there was software engineering, there was computer science. The first academic
departments of computer science were established during the 1950s.Among these was the
computer science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A few decades
later, academic departments offering courses on software engineering began to emerge.
One of the first widely recognized academic departments devoted to software engineering
was established at Carnegie Mellon University. This department enjoyed great recognition
because it became associated with the Software Engineering Institute (SEI). The SEI was
one of the first organizations to promote industry-wide standards for the development
of software.
Although many computer scientists work as software engineers or software developers,
software engineering differs from computer science. Software engineering tends to use
established knowledge to solve specific, practical problems that usually have a fairly high
degree of public visibility. Computer science concentrates on theoretical and mathematical
questions that might receive little public attention. Research and exploration that are
not focused on immediate applications characterize computer science as an academic discipline.
Computer scientists work to extend the knowledge fostered by computer studies.
Software engineers apply their knowledge to the creation of products that have fairly
immediate utility.
