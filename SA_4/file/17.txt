Beta
When you create a beta release of a product, you create something you are willing to ship
to customers. The functionality of the product is complete.You are looking for a thorough
testing effort on the part of the product users. The beta release allows you to subject the
product to a thorough test cycle that involves actual users or customers rather than professional
testers.
Before you ship the release version to the customer, you usually have the customer sign an
agreement. The agreement protects you from liabilities that the product might present. It
also establishes ground rules, such as how long the beta test will go on, how defects will
be handled, and whether you are liable for damages that the user might suffer because of
using the software. In the world of computer games, such an agreement might seem
unnecessary, but it is still important to pay attention to liabilities and limitations. An
example of a liability might be that an online user of your game creates a character profile,
investing many hours, only to discover that with the first release, the character profile
is no longer valid. If this player is not warned beforehand about the loss of data, he is likely
to be extremely dissatisfied with your game.
An example of a limitation is that you must tell those who install the beta release that after
a certain time, you will no longer support the beta release. Although in some situations it
might be reasonable to try to support a beta release even after the first production release,
in most cases, such a move is absurd. After all, the first release should contain all the fixes
to the product that were issued during the beta test.
You also extend or establish an issue tracking system that enables the customer to report
all use issues.Not having such a system in place at the start of the beta trial wastes the time
and energy of everyone involved.
