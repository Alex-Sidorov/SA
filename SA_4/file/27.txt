The central idea of ??synergetics is the possibility of spontaneous self-organization, i.e., the emergence of new or complication of existing internal structures, according to general laws in the material systems of any nature, living, inanimate and social. The main conditions for self-organization are considered to be: 1) a significant distance of the system from equilibrium, internal or with the environment; 2) the open nature of the system, i.e. the drift of energy, substances, magnetic, financial, informational and other flows through the system; 3) interaction between parts of the system.
Synergetic is called the modern interdisciplinary natural science theory of self-organization. More precisely, these are several overlapping theories in various fields of knowledge about nature. The development of research in the field of chemical thermodynamics has become a historical prerequisite for synergy, and the main area of ??its modern applications is physical chemistry. The core of synergy is thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes and its generalization, which I. Prigogine called the theory of dissipative structures. The theory of oscillations and waves plays a significant role in synergetics. Synergetics is also defined as the physics of open systems. Today, the ideas of synergetics are used in almost all areas of science, and synergetics itself claims the role of a new paradigm (Greek. Paradeigma - example, example) of natural science and all modern, post-non-classical science.
