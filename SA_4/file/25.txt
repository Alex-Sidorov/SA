The philosophy of the Renaissance acts as a self-consciousness of the new era, addressed to ancient culture, ancient scholarship, ancient way of life and at the same time as a way out of the Middle Ages, overcoming medieval scholasticism and the dictates of religion, which was due to the following changes in society:
- the first rudiments of capitalist industry
- accumulation of trading and usury capital
- the invention of magnetic powder, powder, clock, printing press
- great geographical discoveries
- progressive urban development
- secularization (liberation from church dependence) of society, anticlericalism (criticism of church ministers)
- release of the person from class restrictions.
The new era has revealed the decline and backwardness of medieval culture, the degradation of morality, the insignificance of man. The past was presented as a “dark age” in which no justification could be found for the world or man. At the same time, a new epoch discovered for itself its past - classical antiquity, found in it that which did not depend on the church, but had its own value and elevated the human spirit. Open antiquity is not just a model for imitation. It manifests itself as a powerful stimulator of cultural activities. It was not a simple borrowing of the cultural values ??of antiquity, but their original creative transformation, the creation of a new culture. And in this creative process, the natural nature of man, his earthly origin, and his constructive cultural and creative abilities were revealed. It turned out that in the world in which man lives, the human is no less than the divine. His efforts created cities, built houses and castles, temples and palaces. He is the creator of painting, music, literature, science and philosophy created by his talent. Man is a genius who creates the world of his existence.
